@article{Bokhove2005,
abstract = {A convection–diffusion model for the averaged flow of a viscous, incompressible magma through an elastic medium is considered. The magma flows through a dike from a magma reservoir to the Earth’s surface; only changes in dike width and velocity over large vertical length scales relative to the characteristic dike width are considered. The model emerges when nonlinear inertia terms in the momentum equation are neglected in a viscous, low-speed approximation of a magma flow model coupled to the elastic response of the rock. Stationary- and traveling-wave solutions are presented in which a Dirichlet condition is used at the magma chamber; and either a (i) free-boundary condition, (ii) Dirichlet condition, or (iii) choked-flow condition is used at the moving free or fixed-top boundary. A choked-flow boundary condition, generally used in the coupled elastic wave and magma flow model, is also used in the convection–diffusion model. The validity of this choked-flow condition is illustrated by comparing stationary flow solutions of the convection–diffusion and coupled elastic wave and magma flow model for parameter values estimated for the Tolbachik volcano region in Kamchatka, Russia. These free- and fixed-boundary solutions are subsequently explored in a conservative, local discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretization. This method is advantageous for the accurate implementation of the choked flow and free-boundary conditions. It uses a mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian finite element with special infinite curvature basis function near the free boundary and ensures positivity of the mean aperture subject to a time-step restriction. We illustrate the model further by simulating magma flow through host rock of variable density, and magma flow that is quasi-periodic due to the growth and collapse of a lava dome.},

@article{Pinel2000,
abstract = {A volcanic edi­ ce exerts a large load at Earth’s surface and modi­ es the stress ­ eld at depth. We investigate how this a¬ects upward dyke propagation towards the surface. For given edi­ ce dimensions and pressure conditions in the deep maga source, there is a critical density threshold above which magmas cannot reach the surface. This density threshold is a decreasing function of edi­ ce height. For edi­ ce heights in the range 0\{3000 m, the density threshold spans the density range of common natural magmas (between 2700 and 2300 kg m¡3 ). With time, di¬erentiation in a magma chamber generates increasingly evolved magmas with decreasing densities, which favours eruption. However, the edi­ ce grows simultaneously at the surface, which counterbalances this e¬ect. The general tendency is to gradually prevent more and more evolved magmas from reaching the surface. A volcanic edi­ ce acts as a magma ­ lter which prevents eruption and a¬ects the chemical evolution of the chamber through its control on magma withdrawal. Thus, one may not consider that eruption products are random samples of an evolving magma reservoir. The partial destruction of an edi­ ce may lead to renewed eruption of primitive and dense magmas.}},

abstract = {We use data from broadband seismometers deployedaround the summit of Kilauea Volcano to quantify the mechanism associated with a transient in the flow of magma feeding the east rift eruption of the volcano. The transient is marked by rapid inflation of the Kilauea summit peaking at 22 ttrad 4.5 hours after the event onset, followedby slow deflation over a period of 3 days. Superimposed the on summit inflation is a seriesof sawtooth displacementpulses,each characterizedby a suddendrop in amplitude lasting 5-10 s followedby an exponentialrecoverylasting 1- 3 min. The sawtoothwaveforms displayalmostidenticalshapes, suggesting process a involving the repeated activation of a fixed source. The particle motion associated with each sawtooth is almost linear, and its major swing showscompressional motion at all stations. Analysesof semblance and particle motion are consistent with a point sourcelocated I km beneath the northeast edgeof the Halemaumau pit crater. To estimate the source mechanism, we apply a moment tensor inversion to the waveformdata, assuminga point sourceembeddedin a homogeneous half-space with compressional and shear wave velocitiesrepresentativeof the averagemedium properties at shallow depth under Kilauea. Synthetic waveformsare constructedby a superpositionof impulse responses six moment tensor componentsand three for single force components. The origin times of individual impulsesare distributed along the time axis at appropriately small, equal intervals, and their amplitudes are determined by least squares. In this inversion, the source time functions of the six tensor and three force components are determined simultaneously. We confirm the accuracy of the inversionmethod through a seriesof numerical tests. The results from the inversionshow that the waveformdata are well explained by a pulsating transport mechanismoperating on a subhorizontalcrack linking the summit reservoir to the east rift of Kilauea. The crack acts like a buffer in which a batchof fluid (magmaand/or gas)accumulates a periodof 1-3 min before over beingrapidlyinjected into a largerreservoir (possibly eastrift) overa timescale the of 5-10 s. The seismicmoment and volume changeassociatedwith a typical batch of fluid are approximately TM rn and 3000ma, respectively. results 10 N Our also point to the existence a single of forcecomponent with amplitude 109N, which of may be explainedas the drag forcegenerated the flow of viscous by magmathrough a narrow constrictionin the flow path. The total volume of magma associated with the 4.5-hour-long activation the pulsating of source roughly500,000ma in is good agreementwith the integrated volume flow rate of magma estimated near the eruptive site.},

@article{Poland2009,
abstract = {During mid-June 2007, the summit of Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i, deflated rapidly as magma drained from the subsurface to feed an east rift zone intrusion and eruption. Coincident with the deflation, summit SO2 emission rates rose by a factor of four before decaying to background levels over several weeks. We propose that SO2 release was triggered by static decompression caused by magma withdrawal from Kīlauea's shallow summit reservoir. Models of the deflation suggest a pressure drop of 0.5–3 MPa, which is sufficient to trigger exsolution of the observed excess SO2 from a relatively small volume of magma at the modeled source depth beneath Kīlauea's summit. Static decompression may also explain other episodes of deflation accompanied by heightened gas emission, including the precursory phases of Kīlauea's 2008 summit eruption. Hazards associated with unexpected volcanic gas emission argue for increased awareness of magma reservoir pressure fluctuations.},

@article{Hoffmann1990,
abstract = {Horizontal ground deformation measure- ments were made repeatedly with an electronic distance meter near the Puu Oo eruption site approximately per- pendicular to Kilauea's east rift zone (ERZ) before and after eruptive episodes 22-42. Line lengths gradually extended during repose periods and rapidly contracted about the same amount following eruptions. The re- peated extension and contraction of the measured lines are best explained by the elastic response of the coun- try rock to the addition and subsequent eruption of magma from a local reservoir. The deformation pat- terns are modeled to constrain the geometry and loca- tion of the local reservoir near Puu Oo. The observed deformation is consistent with deformation patterns that would be produced by the expansion of a shallow, steeply dipping dike just uprift of Puu Oo striking pa- rallel to the trend of the ERZ. The modeled dike is cen- tered about 800 m uprift of Puu Oo. Its top is at a depth of 0.4 km, its bottom at about 2.9 km, and the length is about 1.6 km; the dike strikes N65 \~{} E and dips at about 87 \~{} SE. The model indicates that the dike expanded by 11 cm during repose periods, for an average volumetric expansion of nearly 500 000 m 3. The volume of magma added to the dike during repose periods was variable but correlates positively with the volume of erupted lava of the subsequent eruption and represents about 8\% of the new lava extruded. Dike geometry and ex- pansion values are used to estimate the pressure in- crease near the eruption site due to the accumulation of magma during repose periods. On average, vent pres- sures increased by about 0.38 MPa during the repose periods, one-third of the pressure increase at the sum- mit. The model indicates that the dikelike body below Puu Oo grew in volume from 3 million cubic meters (Mm 3) to about 10-12 Mm 3 during the series of erup- tions. The width of this body was probably about 2.5- 3.0 m. No net long-term deformation was detected along the measured deformation lines.},

@article{Shamberger2006,
abstract = {Geochemical modeling of magma mixing allows for evaluation of volumes of magma storage reservoirs and magma plumbing configurations. A new analytical expression is derived for a simple two-component box-mixing model describing the proportions of mixing components in erupted lavas as a function of time. Four versions of this model are applied to a mixing trend spanning episodes 3–31 of Kilauea Volcano’s Puu Oo eruption, each testing different constraints on magma reservoir input and output fluxes. Unknown parameters (e.g., magma reservoir influx rate, initial reservoir volume) are optimized for each model using a non-linear least squares technique to fit model trends to geochemical time-series data. The modeled mixing trend closely reproduces the observed compositional trend. The two models that match measured lava effusion rates have constant magma input and output fluxes and suggest a large pre-mixing magma reservoir (46±2 and 49±1 million m 3 ), with little or no volume change over time. This volume is much larger than a previous estimate for the shallow, dike-shaped magma reservoir under the Puu Oo vent, which grew from ∼3 to ∼10–12 million m 3 . These volumetric differences are interpreted as indicating that mixing occurred first in a larger, deeper reservoir before the magma was injected into the overlying smaller reservoir.},

abstract = {Detailed study of rates and extent of ground deformation during and following the September 1984 eruption of the Krafla volcano, northeast Iceland, revealed the existence of several reservoirs that feed magma towards the volcano. A shallow magma reservoir -- the Krafla magma reservoir -- appears to be centered 2.6 km below the central part of the Krafla caldera. Three additional magma reservoirs, each displaying its own charac- teristic flow behavior, feed magma into the shallow reservoir. Reservoir I supplied very rapid flow during and immediately after the eruption. Reservoir II was the dominant supplier of magma 3 weeks to 4 months after the beginning of the 2 week long eruption. Reservoir III had dominated the supply of magma to the shallow reservoir for two years prior to the eruption. Reservoir I lies at a depth of less than 10 km and may be regarded as a smaller downward continuation of the shallow Krafla reservoir. Reservoir II appears to be deeper than 20 km and to have a volume roughly 5 times that of the shallow res- ervoir. Reservoir III lies at an indetermined depth, and its volume is immense. The Krafla volcano started to deflate at about 20h20 on September 4, 1984, and the eruption commenced at 23h49 and continued until September 18. The lava covered a 24-kin \~{} area, and its volume can be roughly estimated as l 0 s m 3. About 20 million m 3 of magma were emplaced as a dike, one meter thick and 8.5 km long, below the eruptive fissure. The deflation of the volcano as measured by the volume of the subsidence bowl, shows that 60--80 million m 3 of magma escaped from the shallow magma reservoir im- mediately before and during the eruption.},

@article{Parfitt1994,
abstract = {The 1983-1986 P u ' u ' O ' o eruption of Kilauea volcano had a very distinctive episodic character which later changed to steady-state activity. In this paper we present a physical model of episodic activity which explains the process largely in terms of non-uniform magma cooling and yield strength development resulting from variable dike width. The model is applied to the P u ' u ' O ' o data set and shows that, to explain the pressure variations within the summit magma reservoir and the patterns of summit deflation, a yield strength of 80 to 200 Pa needs to be developed. This corresponds to a temperature decrease in the magma of \~{} 10-15 °C (consistent with tem- perature variations measured in the erupted lavas). The model simulates the variation in volume flux as a function of time through the eruption and produces results which agree well with observed patterns of magma movement. Gradual evolution of the dike system through the eruptive series is explained by progressive widening of its nar- rowest sections. The loss of the episodic character and the transition to continuous activity is explained by a slight change in the thermal efficiency of the system. The change in pattern of gas release (from lava fountaining to gas pistoning and strombolian activity) which accompanied the change from episodic activity to steady-state eruption results from the reduction in magma flow rate at shallow levels in the dike system. However, we demonstrate that continuous eruptions do not inherently lack lava fountains - - higher magma supply rates and thus higher flow velocities would allow fountaining to occur during continuous eruption. We demonstrate that episodic eruptions result from a fine balance between the effects of cooling of magma within the dike and the generation of pressure within the magma reservoir and thus that, thermally, episodic eruptions reflect a middle ground between short- lived fissure eruptions in which magma cooling dominates and continuous eruption in which cooling is minimised, the initial few months of an eruption being critical to establishing the thermal viability of the dike system.},

Each eruptive phase was accompanied by sub- sidence of the summit region and followed by reinflation of the summit to approximately the same level before renewal of eruptive activity. The cyclic summit tilt pattern and the absence of measurable tilt changes near the eruptive site suggest that conditions in the summit region controlled the timing of the last six eruptive phases. The rate of summit subsidence progressively increased from one eruptive phase to the next during the last six phases; the amplitude of harmonic tremor increased during the last four phases. The increases in subsidence rate and in tremor amplitude suggest that frequent periods of magma movement have reduced the flow resistance of the conduit system between the summit and the rift zone.},

Here we present analytical solutions and a practical procedure based on an order of magnitude analysis that permits the characterization of the regime and estimation of the main features of the flow. The ranges of validity of analytical and asymptotic solutions were bounded by using results from fully two-dimensional (2-D) numerical solutions of mass, momentum, and energy equations for magma flow inside a cylindrical conduit and the heat conduction in the surrounding host rocks. The results permitted the identification of three regimes: a conductive-heat-loss-dominated regime, an intermediate regime, and a viscous-heating-dominated regime. Some useful analytical parameterizations are proposed for estimating friction in simplified 1-D models. Temperature layering due to heat loss by conduction can lead to local crystal growth and magma solidification whereas heat generated by viscous dissipation can be responsible for crystal resorption and remelting of wall rocks.},

Little chemical variation is observed within the episode 30 lavas before or after this abrupt change, suggesting a ̄ ̄ sharp compositional interface within the Pu`u `O`o dike-like shallow reservoir. Cooling-induced crystal fractionation in this reservoir is thought to be the main control on intraepisode compositional variation. Potential explanations for a sharp interface, such as changing reservoir width and wall rock thermal properties, are evaluated using a simple thermal model of a dike-like body surrounded by wall rock with spatially variable thermal conductivity. The model that best reproduces the compositional data involves a change in wall rock thermal conductivity from 2.7 to 9 W m\`{A}1 C\`{A}1, which is consistent with deep drill hole data in the east rift zone. The change in thermal conductivity may indicate that fluid flow in the east rift zone is restricted to shallow depths possibly by increasing numbers of dikes acting as aquicludes and/or decreasing pore space due to formation of secondary minerals. Results suggest that wall rock thermal gradients can strongly influence magma chemistry in shallow reservoirs.},

abstract = {The fluid dynamics of the well-documented eruptive episodesat Pu'u 'O' o, Kilauea (Wolfe et at., 1987) are usedto investigate quantitativeely size and shapeof the shallow the conduit system beneath the vent. Cooling calculations are employed to study the long-term survival of conduits and the consequencesof multiple dike injection events. We find that the subvent conduit must have a planar geometry at depths greater than a few tens to at most a few hundreds of meters, with a width of less than a few meters, a length of the order of 100 m, and a height of the order of 1 km. This structure is clearly the residue of the preeruption dikes. Although such a feature can be widened somewhat by repeated dike emplacement events, there is no evidenceto suggestthat a larger and much more equant magma reservoir should developat shallow depth. The extensivedegassing often occurringafter single erup- tions or betweenrepeatederuptions, previouslythought to imply the presenceof a large equi- dimensionalshallowmagma chamber, can be readily explained by the volume of magma in a dikelike subventplanar magma storagezone. On the basis of these observations,which we infer to apply commonlyto basaltic eruption sites, we suggestthat the terms "chamber" or "reservoir" be used with caution, because they most often connote a relatively large equant magma body, distinct from the feeder dike, lying just below the vent. We find that the sub- vent region has the same basic geometric characteristicsas the parental dike, and we propose that it be referred to as a "planar magma storage zone".},

@article{Garcia1992,
abstract = {The Puu Oo eruption of Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii is one of its largest and most compositionally varied historical eruptions. The mineral and whole-rock compositions of the Puu Oo lavas indicate that there were three compositionally distinct magmas involved in the eruption. Two of these magmas were differentiated (< 6.8 wt\% MgO) and were apparently stored in the rift zone prior to the eruption. A third, more mafic magma (9-10 wt\% MgO) was probably intruded as a dike from Kilauea's summit reservoir just before the start of the eruption. Its intrusion forced the other two magmas to mix, forming a hybrid that erupted during the first three eruptive episodes from a fissure system of vents. A new hybrid was erupted during episode 3 from the vent where Puu Oo later formed. The composition of the lava erupted from this vent became progressively more mafic over the next 21 months, although significant compositional variation occurred within some eruptive episodes. The intra-episode compositional variation was probably due to crystal fractionation in the shallow (0.0-2.9 kin), dike-shaped (i.e. high surface area/vol- ume ratio) and open-topped Puu Oo magma reservoir. The long-term compositional variation was controlled largely by mixing the early hybrid with the later, more mafic magma. The percentage of mafic magma in the erupted lava increased progressively to 100\% by episode 30 (about two years after the eruption started). Three separate magma reservoirs were involved in the Puu Oo eruption. The two deeper reservoirs (3-4 kin) recharged the shallow (0.4-2.9 kin) Puu Oo reservoir. Recharge of the shallow reservoir occurred rapidly during an erup- tion indicating that these reservoirs were well connected. The connection with the early hybrid magma body was cut off before episode 30. Subsequently, only mafic magma from the summit reservoir has recharged the Puu Oo reservoir.},

abstract = {The ascent of magma to the Earth's surface is commonly modeled by assuming a fixed dike or flow geometry from a deep subsurface reservoir to the surface. In practice, however, this flow geometry is produced by deformation of the crust by ascending overpressured magma. Here, we explore how this elastic deformation is coupled to magma ascent using a model of a planar dike whose width is allowed to evolve with depth in the crust. The model predicts that, for points well below the surface, the dike gradually narrows with height above the source reservoir as the overpressure of the magma relative to the minimum horizontal stress in the crust decreases. For a bubbly compressible magma, the flow accelerates to the surface and reaches the speed of sound at the vent, as for rigid conduit flow. However, it is now able to decompress to atmospheric pressure at the vent by contraction of the conduit. Our calculations predict eruption rates on the order of 0.1–10 m2/s per unit length of a dike, for magma supplied from a reservoir with overpressure in the range − 10 MPa to + 20 MPa.},

abstract = {The relatively low rates of magma production in island arcs and continental extensional settings require that the volume of silicic magma involved in large catastrophic caldera-forming (CCF) eruptions must accu- mulate over periods of 105 to 106 years. We address the question of why buoyant and otherwise eruptible high- silica magma should accumulate for long times in shallow chambers rather than erupt more continuously as magma is supplied from greater depths. Our hypothesis is that the viscoelastic behavior of magma chamber wall rocks may prevent an accumulation of overpressure sufficient to generate rhyolite dikes that can propagate to the surface and cause an eruption. The critical overpressure required for eruption is based on the model of Rubin (1995a). An approximate analytical model is used to evaluate the controls on magma overpressure for a continuously or episodically replenished spherical magma chamber con- tained in wall rocks with a Maxwell viscoelastic rheology. The governing parameters are the long-term magma supply, the magma chamber volume, and the effective viscosity of the wall rocks. The long-term magma supply, a parameter that is not typically incorporated into dike formation models, can be constrained from observations and melt generation models. For effective wall-rock viscosities in the range 1018 to 1020 Pa s–1, dynamical regimes are identified that lead to the suppression of dikes.},

abstract = {Failure of the margins of magma chambers produces dykes which may breach the ground surface and cause an eruption. The pressurization and failure of liquid-filled cavities is investigated with experiments in which gelatine is used as the analogue for a crustal medium. A theoretical analysis is derived which considers dyke nucleation to occur by the failure of a pre-existing magma-filled crack in the chamber wall. Flow of magma from the chamber into the crack gradually pressurizes and widens the crack. Eventually, the stress conditions for failure of the crack-tip are attained and dyke propagation commences. Magma viscosity influences the flux into the crack and hence the rate at which the crack-pressure increases. Higher viscosity magmas consequently require greater chamber overpressures and/or longer time delays before dyke nucleation occurs. The theoretical analysis is in approximate agreement with experimental results and provides estimates of the critical conditions required for a magma chamber to rupture. If a basaltic magma chamber is suddenly pressurized (e.g., by replenishment), the delay before dyke nucleation is predicted to be on the order of hours to days. For rhyolitic magmas, the delays are typically many years. Where chambers are gradually becoming pressurized (e.g., by exsolution during magmatic crystallization), cracks in the walls of relatively silicic magma chambers are likely to be further from pressure equilibration with the chamber, resulting in the development of higher chamber overpressures before dyke nucleation occurs. Solidification in silicic cracks which are slowly pressurizing may inhibit crack-tip failure; greater chamber overpressures are consequently required before dykes eventually form. The implications of higher chamber overpressures during dyke nucleation are that repose periods are longer, dykes propagate further before freezing, which allows dykes to transport silicic magmas over substantial distances, and a more vigorous eruption occurs if the dyke breaches the surface.},

abstract = {The January 1997 East Rift Zone eruption on Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, occurred within a networkof continuous GlobalPositioning System(GPS) receivers. The GPS measurementsreveal the temporal history of deformation during dike intrusion, beginning •- 8 hours prior to the onset of the eruption. The dike volume as a function of time, estimated from the GPS data using elastic (]reen's functions for a homogeneous half-space,showsthat only two thirds of the final dike volume accumulated prior to the eruption and the rate of volume change decreasedwith time. These observations inconsistentwith simple modelsof dike propagation, are which predict acceleratingdike volume up to the time of the eruption and little or no changethereafter. Deflationary tilt changesat Kilauea summit mirror the inferred dike volume history, suggesting that the rate of dike propagation is limited by flow of magma into the dike. A simple, lumped parameter model of a coupled dike magma chamber system showsthat the tendency for a dike to end in an eruption (rather than intrusion) is favoredby high initial dike pressures, compressional stressstates, large, compressiblemagma reservoirs,and highly conductive conduits linking the dike and source reservoirs. Comparison of model predictions to the observed dike volume history, the ratio of erupted to intruded magma, and the deflationary history of the summit magma chamber suggestthat most of the magma suppliedto the growing dike came from sources near to the eruption through highly conductive conduits. Interpretation is complicated by the presenceof multiple sourcereservoirs,magma vesiculation and cooling, as well as spatial variations in dike-normal stress. Reinflation of the summit magma chamber following the eruption was measuredby GPS and accompanieda rise in the level of the Pu'u O'o lava lake. For a spheroidal chamber these data imply a summit magma chamber volume •- 20 km consistent of 3, with recent estimates from seismic tomography. Continuous deformation measurementscan be used to image the spatiotemporal evolution of propagating dikes and to reveal quantitative information about the volcanic plumbing systems.},

abstract = {The eruption style of silicic magmas is affected by the loss of gas (outgassing) during ascent. We investigate outgassing using a numerical model for one-dimensional, two-phase, steady flow in a volcanic conduit. By implementing Forchheimer’s equation rather than Darcy’s equation for outgassing we are able to investigate the relative influence of Darcian and inertial permeability on the transition between effusive and explosive eruptions. These permeabilities are defined by constitutive equations obtained from textural analysis of pyroclasts and determined by bubble number density, throat–bubble size ratio, tortuosity, and roughness. The efficiency of outgassing as a function of these parameters can be quantified by two dimensionless quantities: the Stokes number, the ratio of the response time of the magma and the characteristic time of gas flow, and the Forchheimer number, the ratio of the viscous and inertial forces inside the bubble network. A small Stokes number indicates strong coupling between gas and magma and thus promotes explosive eruption. A large Forchheimer number signifies that gas escape from the bubble network is dominated by inertial effects, which leads to explosive behaviour. To provide context we compare model predictions to the May 18, 1980 Mount St. Helens and the August–September 1997 Soufriere Hills eruptions. We show that inertial effects dominate outgassing during both effusive and explosive eruptions, and that in this case the eruptive regime is determined by a new dimensionless quantity defined by the ratio of Stokes and Forchheimer number. Of the considered textural parameters, the bubble number density has the strongest influence on this quantity. This result has implications for permeability studies and conduit modelling.},

@article{Pinel2004,
abstract = {A volcanic edifice generates a compressive stress field in the upper crust which affects magma transport. As a central cone builds up, primitive magmas can no longer erupt through the focal area and stall at depth. Within a vertical column terminating below the Earth’s surface, magma is overpressured with respect to the surroundings and may feed a horizontally propagating dyke. We define three regimes for magma transport as a function of magma buoyancy, edifice size and density stratification in the upper crust: (1) eruption through the summit, (2) storage beneath the edifice, (3) horizontal propagation to feed a distal eruptive vent. We study the dynamics of horizontal dyke propagation away from the focal area of a volcanic field. Large horizontal propagation distances can only be achieved if an edifice prevents eruption through the focal area and if magma is negatively buoyant at shallow depth. With no edifice, a horizontal dyke is always tallest at the injection point, implying that, if it is able to breach the surface, it only does so in the focal area. With an edifice, at small distances from the axis, confining stresses due to the edifice load act to impede vertical propagation. In this case, a horizontal dyke does not grow vertically at the injection point and develops a hump at some distance from the focal area, which accounts for distal eruptive centers. During propagation, this hump may be far removed from the dyke tip and migrates at a different velocity. All else being equal, a decreasing supply rate or a decreasing magma viscosity generate eruptive centers at increasing distances from the focal area. This is consistent with the distribution of erupted products in many volcanic fields, such that, with increasing distance from the focal area, magma compositions are less and less evolved.},

abstract = {The dynamics of magma flow through a reservoir connected to a fissure in an elastic medium is investigated. Magma is supplied to the reservoir at a rate which may vary with time. The distribution of fluid pressure, the elastic deformation of the reservoir walls and the characteristics of dyke intrusion are calculated for a range of reservoir sizes and supply rates. Magma is stored in the reservoir whilst magma is intruded in the fissure. At high supply rates, the reservoir pressure increases by large amounts and only small amounts of magma flow into the fissure. Conversely, at low supply rates, most of the magma supplied to the system is injected into the fissure. For a given supply rate, the amount stored depends weakly on the reservoir size, and is largest for small reservoirs. The delay between the onset of reservoir inflation (i.e., the start of magma input) and the opening of the fissure decreases with increasing reservoir size. Rapid deflation of the reservoir occurs if the supply rate decreases with time. All else being equal, the largest reservoir pressures are reached for high supply rates, which suggests that these conditions lead to summit eruptions. Rift-zone intrusions are most extensive at low supply rates.},

@article{Buck2006,
abstract = {The best-studied dike intrusion events on a divergent plate boundary occurred along the Krafla segment of the northern rift zone in Iceland from 1975–1984. Seismic and geodetic measurements there showed that a central magma chamber fed dikes that propagated laterally many times the thickness of the lithosphere. The patterns of dike length, dike width, caldera subsidence, and lava extrusion strongly suggest that dike propagation is affected by tectonic stresses that change with each dike intrusion event and that magma pressures are linked to the dike opening. These observations have inspired us to develop a quantitative model for the lateral propagation of basaltic dikes away from a magma chamber. We assume dikes propagate as long as there is sufficient driving pressure, defined as the difference between magma pressure and tectonic stress at the dike tip. The opening dike and the magma chamber are treated as a closed system for a given dike intrusion event. During an event, magma pressure is reduced linearly with the magma volume withdrawn from the chamber. Relative tectonic tension in the lithosphere is reduced linearly as the dike width increases. A dike begins propagation when the driving pressure equals the ‘‘breakout’’ pressure needed to force the magma out of the chamber. It stops when the driving pressure reaches a minimum value. Generally, the dike width is proportional to this ‘‘stopping’’ pressure, and a reasonable value gives a width of 1 m. Besides the breakout and stopping pressures, the propagation distance depends on the initial distribution of tectonic stress and the thickness of the lithosphere cut by a dike. The intrusion of a dike changes the tectonic stress distribution so that subsequent dikes may propagate different distances and directions than the first dike. After a period of magma chamber refilling, a new dike can initiate if the breakout pressure is reached. For an idealized spreading segment the tectonic stress field evolves to produce a sequence of dikes propagating in one direction followed by a sequence of dikes propagating in the opposite direction. The first dike in each sequence should be the longest followed by successively shorter dikes. When tectonic stresses close to a magma chamber have been largely relieved, then extrusion of magma may start. The model pattern of dike propagation and extrusion is consistent with data from the Krafla episode. Magma chamber size should have a major effect on magmatic systems in other tectonic settings with larger magma chambers producing longer characteristic dikes.},

abstract = {Magmatic accretion at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges exhibits specific features. Although magma supply is focused at the centre of second-order segments, melts are episodically distributed along the rift toward segment ends by lateral dyke intrusions. It has been previously suggested that an along-axis downward to- pographic slope away from the magma source is sufficient to explain lateral dyke propagation. However, this cannot account for the poor correlation between dyke opening and surface elevation in the 2005–2010 series of 14 dyke intrusions of Afar (Ethiopia). Using mechanical arguments, constrained by both geodetic and seismological observations, we propose that the large dykes that initiate near the mid-segment magma source are attracted toward segment ends as a result of a thickening of the elastic–brittle lithosphere in the along-rift direction. This attraction arises from the difference of elastic resistance between the segment centre where the lithosphere is thermally weakened by long-term focusing of melts, and comparatively “colder”, hence stronger segment ends. The axial topographic gradient in magmatic rifts may be more likely explained as an incidental consequence of these variations of along-axis elastic–brittle thickness, rather than the primary cause of lateral dyke injections.},

abstract = {Buoyancy-driven flows resulting from the introduction of fluid of one density into a crack embedded in an elastic solid of different density are analysed. Scaling arguments are used to determine the regimes in which different combinations of the buoyancy force, elastic stress, viscous pressure drop and material toughness provide the dominant pressure balance in the flow. The nonlinear equations governing the shape and rate of spread of the propagating crack are formulated for the cases of vertical propagation of buoyant fluid released into a solid of greater density and of lateral propagation of fluid released at an interface between an upper layer of lesser density and a lower layer of greater density. Similarity solutions of these equations are derived under the assumption that the volume of fluid is given by Qt“, where Q and a are constants. Both laminar and turbulent flows are considered. Fluid fracture is an important mechanism for the transport of molten rock from the region of production in the Earth’s mantle to surface eruptions or near-surface emplacement. The theoretical solutions provide simple models which describe the relation between the elastic and fluid-mechanical phenomena involved in the vertical transport of melt through the Earth’s lithosphere and in the lateral intrusion of melt a t a neutral-buoyancy level close to the Earth’s surface.},

abstract = {We characterize wave propagation along an infinitely long crack or conduit in an elastic solid containing a compressible, viscous fluid. Fluid flow is described by quasi-one- dimensional mass and momentum balance equations with a barotropic equation of state, and the wall shear stress is written as a general function of width-averaged velocity, den- sity, and conduit width. Our analysis focuses on small perturbations about steady flow, through a constant width conduit, at an unperturbed velocity determined by balancing the pressure gradient with drag from the walls. Short wavelength disturbances propagate relative to the fluid as sound waves with negligible changes in conduit width. The elastic walls become more compliant at longer wavelengths since strains induced by opening or closing the conduit are smaller, and the fluid compressibility becomes negligible. As wavelength increases, the sound waves transition to crack waves propagating relative to the fluid at a slower phase velocity that is inversely proportional to the square-root of wavelength. Associated with the waves are density, velocity, pressure, and width pertur- bations that alter drag. At sufficiently fast flow rates, crack waves propagating in the flow direction are destabilized when drag reduction from opening the conduit exceeds the increase in drag from increased fluid velocity. This instability may explain the occurrence of self-excited oscillations in fluid-filled cracks.},

abstract = {Earthquakes in Hawaii are byproducts of volcanism; almost all of them occur beneath or near the island of Hawaii and its active volcanoes. Traveltimes of longitudinal waves indicate that the Mohorovicic discontinuity is depressed only a few kilometers beneath the Hawaiian Ridge, where it lies about 15 km below sea level. The pattern of ground deformation around the summit of Kilauea Volcano suggests that magma rising from a deep source accumulates slowly in a reservoir a few kilometers beneath the caldera and then is discharged rapidly during an eruption. This reservoir is the principal immediate source of lava discharged through a rift zone during a flank eruption. Periodic swarms of deep earthquakes from a zone in the mantle about 60 km beneath the summit of Kilauea outline a possible source of magma for the volcano. Swarms of small shallow earthquakes herald the opening of fissures within the volcano and provide short-term warnings of impending eruptions. More persistent swarms of somewhat larger, shallow earthquakes stem from widespread failure in rocks surrounding the summit reservoir during severe downwarping of the summit when the reservoir is deflated by an important flank eruption.},

abstract = {We review the factors determining lava fountain heights in tIawaiian-style basaltic eruptions such as those occurring during the recent series of eruptive episodes at the Pu'u 'O'o vent, east rift zone of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. Numerical solutions to the equations describing the fluid dynamics of such eruptions predict that lava fountain heights,which are indicators of the velocity of magmas in vents, should be controlled much more strongly by amounts of exsolved volatiles than by any other factors. The next most important factor is the width of the conduit system, which determines frictional lossesand can be characterized by the volume flux of magma. The diameter of the surface vent required to accommodate a given discharge (i.e., instantaneousvolume rate of eruption) is also a function of exsolved magma volatile content but is less dependent on this factor than is the fountain height. We simulate fountain heights for typical dischargesat Pu'u 'O'o and find implied eXsolvedgas contents very close to those determined by other methods. The corresponding predicted vent diameters are comparable with (and somewhat smaller than) the observed diameter of the Pu'u 'O'o vent. The discrepancyis probably a consequenceof processesoccurring in the lava pond which is present over the vent during eruptions. The variation of fountain height with time during eruptive episodescan be used as a measure of changing exsolved tnagma volatile content, which can be related to processes occurring in the subsurface dike system.},

abstract = {In basaltic pyroclastic eruptions, two variables - magma gas content and magma volume flux - - determine the detailed dynamic structure of the fountain and the size distribution of clasts within it. The fountain structure and clast size distribution in turn determine the nature of the resulting deposits, whether these be stationary pyroclastic constructs or active lava flows. Although the physical relationships between gas content and clast size are not fully understood, empirical data are available for basaltic eruptions. Fountain dynamic structure is determined by the velocity profile at any given pressure level and the maximum spread angle of the fountain from the vertical. These two parameters completely determine the paths of pyroclasts in the fountain and their ultimate resting places. The combination of the pyroclast size and the spatial distribution determines the clast number density and thus the opacity of the fountain and the ability of the pyroclasts to cool in their local fountain environment. For a given set of condi- tions, two factors thus become important in determining the structure and morphology of pyroclastic deposits: local temperature and accumulation rate. For example, in typical basaltic pyroclastic eruptions, the majority of pyroclasts remain inside the optically thick central part of the fountain, undergo minimal cooling, and return to the surface to coalesce and contribute to a lava pond or lava flow. In the optically thinner outer parts of the fountain, clasts undergo relatively more cooling and return to the surface to contribute to the building of the pyroclastic cone (if the accumu- lation rate is low) or to form rootless flows (if the accumulation rate is high and minimal further cooling occurs). The relationships between these various parameters are investigated for Hawaiian-style eruptions in general and applied qualitatively to the interpretation of post-eruption deposits.},

abstract = {Since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, volca- nologists have made considerable progress toward pre- dicting eruptions on the basis of precursors that typically start a few days to several months in advance. Although accurate eruption prediction is by no means routine, it may now be possible in some cases to extend the effec- tive warning period by anticipating the onset of short- term precursors. Three promising indicators of deep magmatic processes are (1) deep, long-period earth- quakes and tremor that indicate the ascent of magma through the crust, (2) magmatic CO2 emission rate as a proxy for magma supply rate, and (3) relatively broad, generally aseismic surface uplift caused by magmatic intrusions. In the latter case it is essential to sample the deformation field thoroughly in both time and space to adequately constrain source models. Until recently, this has been nearly impossible because high-precision sen- sors could not be deployed in sufficient numbers, nor could extensive geodetic surveys be conducted often enough.

Recent Progress in Volcano Hazards Mitigation [2] Considerable progress has been made during the past few decades toward understanding volcanic pro- cesses and mitigating volcano hazards. There have been significant advances in eruption prediction, hazards as- sessment, and public education, which together form the basis for improved preparedness and hazards mitigation. Rather than attempting a comprehensive review of these developments, this paper mentions a few recent suc- cesses and then focuses on one aspect of volcanology, geodesy, that is providing important new insights into the structure and workings of volcanoes. The examples are U.S. and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) centric, but much of the discussion is general and hopefully will be of broad interest. synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and telecommunications are helping to overcome these limitations. As a result, comprehensive geodetic monitoring of selected volcanoes is now feasible. A combination of InSAR, large-aperture GPS surveys, microgravity surveys, and dense arrays of continuous GPS stations, strain meters, and tiltmeters can reveal both spatial and temporal patterns of ground deformation throughout the eruption cycle. Improved geodetic monitoring of many of the world s volcanoes would be a major stride toward better understanding of magmatic processes and longer-term eruption forecasts.},

Numerical models generally agree that, for most eruptions, subsurface volume changes are sufficient to produce measur? able deformation at the surface. Studying this deformation can help to determine the location, volume, and shape of a subsurface magma body and thus to anticipate the onset and course of an eruption. This approach has been successfully applied at many restless volcanoes, especially basaltic shields and silicic calderas, using various geode? tic techniques and sensors. However, its success at many intermediate-composition strato-volcanoes has been limited by generally long repose intervals, steep terrain, and structural influences that complicate the history and shape of surface deforma? characterize deformation in tion.

@article{Woods2003,
abstract = {We explore some of the controls on the evolution of a slow effusive eruption imposed by processes in a shallow magma reservoir. We envisage that the emplacement of basaltic magma into a shallow, evolved crustal reservoir generates sufficient overpressure to trigger the slow effusive eruption of the overlying layer of evolved magma. The subsequent evolution of the system then depends on a number of factors including (1) the volatile contents of the two magmas; (2) the rate of any continuing influx of basalt; (3) the cooling/heating rates of the two layers of magma; and (4) the eruption rate of the silicic magma, where we assume that the crystals and bubbles remain in the layer in which they formed. Any exsolved volatiles in the magma increase the compressibility of the magma. In a waning system, this tends to increase the volume of material, which needs to be erupted to relieve a given overpressure by an amount of order 10–100, and hence increases the duration of the eruption. Typical calculations suggest that eruptions from magma chambers of size 1–10 km3 may persist for times of order 1–10 years if the main body of silicic magma is saturated in volatiles. In addition, cooling of the basalt leads to formation of dense crystals, which lowers the pressure. However, if the magma becomes saturated, exsolution of volatile gases occurs, tending to increase the pressure. Again, in a waning system, this tends to extend the eruption duration and increase the mass erupted from the chamber. For chamber volumes of 1–10 km3, cooling rates of 10\`{A}6 K/s can increase the eruption volume by a factor of order 10. Rapid cooling may also lead to an initial increase in the eruption rate, while the chamber pressure is controlled by the rate of production of new bubbles. If there is an influx of basalt to the chamber which is maintained during the eruption, then the evolution of the eruption is primarily dependent on this input rate, although the cooling of the basalt may increase the eruption rate to values in excess of this input rate, especially at an early stage in the eruption. The complex and nonlinear evolution of the eruption rate predicted by our simple model illustrates the sensitivity of the eruption rate to the magma volatile content and magma cooling rates. Such understanding is key in developing quantitative models for hazard assessments of slow effusive eruptions.},

abstract = {The accumulation of magma within a volcano deforms the ground surface around it. Although pendulum-type tiltmeters are our most sensitive and convenient tool for detecting such deformations, their records are generally difficult to interpret because purely local disturbances obscure the subtle changes produced by the volcano. A new tiltmeter consisting of a permanent tilt base and a portable water-tube leveling system was developed to measure tilting around Kilauea caldera. Because the tilt bases for this instrument are on the ground surface outdoors, the leveling system must be operated under conditions that are far from ideal. If the work is performed at night and if a carefully standardized procedure is followed, leveling can be carried around a circuit consisting of three piers at the vertices of a triangle 2,000 inches on a side with a closure error of less than 10µ (corresponding to an error in the measurement of tilt of less than 0.2 × 10-6 radian). Tilting at four new tilt bases around Kilauea caldera between October, 1958, and February, 1959, shows that the summit of the volcano is swelling. An analysis of the tilting around the caldera suggests that magma is accumulating in a reservoir about 4 kilometers beneath the southwest end of the caldera.},

abstract = {The motion of turbulent jets of heavy salt solution injected upwards into a tank of fresh water has been compared with that of plumes which are initially buoyant but become heavy as they mix with the environment. The reversal of buoyancy in the latter case is produced by using fluids having a non-linear density change on mixing, a laboratory analogue of the density changes occurring at the top of a cumulus cloud due to evaporation. The behaviour in the two cases is quite different; salt jets reach a steady height about which only small fluctuations occur, while the plumes with reversing buoyancy exhibit violent regular oscillations. This phenomenon, which is clearly a property of the ‘evaporation’ and not just of the geometry, is suggested as a likely explanation of the observed oscillation of the tops of cumulus towers. Dimensional arguments have been used to relate the experimental results to the volume, momentum and buoyancy fluxes at the source. An application of one of the deduced relations to the atmosphere gives realistic periods for the cloud-top oscillations.},

abstract = {The mechanism ofmagma transport at depth influences direction magma moves, the distance it travels before freezing, the degree to which it communicates chemically with the host rock, the form of surficial volcanism, and ultimately the growth of oceanic and continental crust. Commonly envisioned transport processes include porous flow in partially molten and deformable source rock, flow through fractures in elasticlbrittle rock, and diapiric ascent (typically of granites) through viscous rock. Of these, transport in fractures, or dikes, is the most efficient means of moving magma through cold lithosphere. Porous flow is an option only if there has been sufficient advection of heat to raise the rock temperature above the solidus (a possibility beneath Hawaii, for example). Although the sheet-like form of dikes is less advantageous thermally than the equidimensional form of diapirs, except for possibly the most viscous rhyolites, this is more than offset by the fact that transport rates depend upon the magma viscosity, rather than the host rock viscosity. Dike intrusion is also the transport mechanism that permits the most direct comparison between theory and observation. In part, this is because many dikes carry so little heat that magmatic and host rock structures produced during in­ trusion are preserved until exposed by erosion. The short timescale of intrusion also allows near-real-time seismic and geodetic monitoring of dikes in active volcanoes. In addition, the close kinship between dikes and artificial hydrofrac­ tures, used in the oil and geothermal industries, provides an economic incentive for monitoring field-scale experiments that are relevant to dike propagation. Fi­ nally, the nominally planar geometry of dikes permits idealizations that make a detailed theoretical treatment practical. While analogous equations describing porous flow in the source region have also been proposed, observations available to constrain these theories are fewer and less direct. The situation is worse for granitic diapirism; because of the complexity of the processes envisioned, and the tendency for later deformations to obliterate earlier ones, even its existence is debated. I begin this review by highlighting the observations of ancient and modern dikes that lay the groundwork for current modeling. The emphasis then shifts to the dominant physical processes involved-host rock fracture and deformation (elastic and inelastic), magma flow, and heat transfer. Previous review articles on some of these topics include those by Pollard ( 1 987) for the solid mechanics, Lister \& Kerr ( 199 1 ) for coupling the fluid flow and elastic deformation, and Delaney ( 1 987) for the heat flow. Where possible this review attempts to provide a framework for thinking about important but poorly understood processes such as dike initiation, the role of dike propagation in the ascent of granitic magmas, and earthquakes accompanying magma transport.},

abstract = {Interpretation of abundant seismic data suggeststhat Kilauea's primary conduit within the upper mantle is concentricallyzoned to about 34-km depth. This zoned structure is inferred to contain a central core region of relatively higher permeability, surrounded by numerous dikes that are in intermittent hydraulic communication with each other and with the central core. During periods of relatively high magma transport, the entire cross section of the conduit is utilized. During periods of relatively low to moderate transport, however, only the central core is active. As the conduit penetrates the oceanic crust and enters the volcanic shield, it simultaneouslysuppliesthe deeper sectionsof the rift zones (6- to 10-km depth) and the roots of the summit reservoir with picritic magma. The rift zones at depth are inferred to be almost wholly molten and to possess high degree of fluid continuity from Heiheiahulu in the East a Rift Zone, 45 km westward through the roots of the summit magma reservoir, and well into the Southwest Rift Zone. Higher in the shield, the subcaldera magma reservoir and the shallow rift zones occupy 2- to 4-km depthinterval.Summit-differentiated the olivinetholeiite(p • 2.62 gcm- 3) is period- ically injected laterally along a horizon of neutral buoyancy within the rift zones,where the density of the magmais just balanced the in situ densityof the shield(Ryan, 1987a,b).

The dike tip in two and three dimensions is surrounded by a tubular core of tensile(ax, a2) and shearstress (Zmax)' displacement The field is characterized counter- by rotating cells on either side of the dike tip which, in vertical orientation, produce the characteristic subsidence above the dike complex, with uplift on either side, forming a ridge-trough-ridge structure.

@article{Vergniolle1990,
abstract = {At Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, the recent long-lived eruptions of Mauna Ulu and Pu'u O'o have occurred in two major stages, defining a characteristic eruptive pattern. The first stage consists of cyclic changes of activity between episodes of "fire fountaining" and periods of quiescence or effusion of vesicular lava. The second stage consists only of continuous effusion of lava. We suggest that these features reflect the dynamics of magma degassing in a chamber which empties into a narrow conduit. In the volcano chamber, gas bubbles rise through magma and accumulate at the roof in a foam layer. The foam flows toward the conduit, and its shape is determined by a dynamic balance between the input of bubbles from below and the output into the conduit. The foam thickness is proportional to (la, lQ/e2ptg) TM, where/a t and Pt are the viscosity and density of magma, e is the gas volume fraction in the foam, g is the acceleration of gravity, and Q is the gas flux. The bubbles in the foam deform under the action of buoyancy, and the maximum permissible foam thickness is hc = 2cr/eplgR, where cr is the coefficient of surface tension and R is the original bubble radius. If this critical thickness is reached, the foam collapses into a large gas pocket which erupts into the conduit. Foam accumulation then resumes, and a new cycle begins. The attainment of the foam collapse threshold requires a gas flux in excess of a critical value which depends on viscosity, surface tension, and bubble size. Hence two different eruption regimes are predicted: (1) alternating regimes of foam buildup and collapse leading to the periodic eruption of large gas volumes and (2) steady foam flow at the roof leading to continuous bubbly flow in the conduit. The essential result is that the continuous process of degassing can lead to discontinuous eruptive behavior. Data on eruption rates and repose times between fountaining phases from the 1969 Mauna Ulu and the 1983-1986 Pu'u O'o eruptions yield constraints on three key variables. The area of the chamber roof must be a few tens of square kilometers, with a minimum value of about 8 km 2. Magma reservoirs of similar dimensions are imaged by seismic attenuation tomography below the east rift zone. Close to the roof, the gas volume fraction is a few percent, and the gas bubbles have diameters lying between 0.1 and 0.6 mm. These estimates are close to the predictions of models for bubble nucleation and growth in basaltic melts, as well as to the observations on deep submarine basalts. The transition between cyclic and continuous activity occurs when the mass flux of gas becomes lower than a critical value of the order of 103 kg/s. In this model, changes of eruptive regime reflect changes in the amount and size of bubbles which reach the chamber roof.},

abstract = {Persistent degassing of closed-conduit explosive volcanoes may be used to inspect and monitor magmatic processes. After interaction with shallow hydrothermal fluids, volcanic gases collected at surface can differ substantially from those exsolved from magma. We report here on an innovative approach to identify and separate the contribution of variable magmatic components from fumarolic gases, by processing the 30-year-long geochemical dataset from the Campi Flegrei caldera, Southern Italy. The geochemical record shows periodic variations, which are well correlated with geophysical signals. Such variations are interpreted as due to the time-varying interplay of two magma degassing sources, each differing in size, depth, composition, and cooling/crystallization histories. Similar multiple degassing sources are common at explosive volcanoes, with frequent ascent and intrusion of small magma batches. Our innovative method permits the identification of those magma batches, which contributes to the interpretation of unrest signals, forecasting and assessment of volcanic hazards.},

@article{Masterlark2010,
abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data indicate that the caldera of Okmok volcano, Alaska, subsided more than a meter during its eruption in 1997. The large deformation suggests a relatively shallow magma reservoir beneath Okmok. Seismic tomography using ambient ocean noise reveals two low-velocity zones (LVZs). The shallow LVZ corresponds to a region of weak, fluid-saturated materials within the caldera and extends from the caldera surface to a depth of 2 km. The deep LVZ clearly indicates the presence of the magma reservoir beneath Okmok that is significantly deeper (>4 km depth) compared to previous geodetic-based estimates (3 km depth). The deep LVZ associated with the magma reservoir suggests magma remains in a molten state between eruptions. We construct finite element models (FEMs) to simulate deformation caused by mass extraction from a magma reservoir that is surrounded by a viscoelastic rind of country rock embedded in an elastic domain that is partitioned to account for the weak caldera materials observed with tomography. This configuration allows us to reduce the estimated magma reservoir depressurization to within lithostatic constraints, while simultaneously maintaining the magnitude of deformation required to predict the InSAR data. More precisely, the InSAR data are best predicted by an FEM simulating a rind viscosity of 7.5 \^{A} 1016 Pa s and a mass flux of \`{A}4.2 \^{A} 109 kg/d from the magma reservoir. The shallow weak layer within the caldera provides a coeruption stress regime and neutral buoyancy horizon that support lateral magma propagation from the central magma reservoir to extrusion near the rim of the caldera.},

abstract = {The 3.7 ka year-old Averno 2 eruption is one of the rare eruptions to have occurred in the northwest sector of the Phlegraean Fields caldera (PFc) over the past 5 ka. We focus here on the fallout deposits of the pyro- clastic succession emplaced during this eruption. We present major and trace element data on the bulk pumices, along with major and volatile element data on clinopy- roxene-hosted melt inclusions, in order to assess the con- ditions of storage, ascent, and eruption of the feeding trachytic magma. Crystal fractionation accounts for the evolution from trachyte to alkali-trachyte magmas; these were intimately mingled (at the micrometer scale) during the climactic phase of the eruption. The Averno 2 alkali trachyte represents one of the most evolved magmas erupted within the Phlegraean Fields area and belongs to the series of differentiated trachytic magmas erupted at different locations 5 ka ago. Melt inclusions record significant variations in H 2 O (from 0.4 to 5 wt\%), S (from 0.01 to 0.06 wt\%), Cl (from 0.75 up to 1 wt\%), and F (from 0.20 to [ 0.50 wt\%) during both magma crystallization and degassing. Unlike the eruptions occur- ring in the central part of the PFc, deep-derived input(s) of gas and/or magma are not required to explain the compo- sition of melt inclusions and the mineralogy of Averno 2 pumices. Compositional data on bulk pumices, glassy matrices, and melt inclusions suggest that the Averno 2 eruption mainly resulted from successive extrusions of independent magma batches probably emplaced at depths of 2–4 km along regional fractures bordering the Neapol- itan Yellow Tuff caldera.},

@article{Marchetti2004,
abstract = {Volcanic explosions generate pressure perturbations in the atmosphere and a seismic wavefield in the ground. The source is therefore well coupled with the atmosphere and the ground. The acoustic and elastic wavefields reflect dynamical processes at the source and the viscoelastic properties of the magma–gas medium. At low pressure (<10 MPa), magma cannot be considered as a homogeneous medium, and must be treated as a mixture of fluid magma and gas bubbles. Acoustic waves are strongly affected by the transmission properties of the magma–gas medium. We analyze the propagation of the acoustic wavefield in a two-phase medium in which the viscosity and compressibility are spatially inhomogeneous. Gas bubble nucleation starts when the magma pressure drops below the supersaturation level (at a depth of a few hundred m for H 2 Oin basaltic magmas) and the gas-volume fraction increases toward the surface, reaching its maximum value at the magma–air interface. The variation of gas-volume fraction is non-linear with depth and is particularly strong at shallow depths (<50 m). Density and sound velocity of the mixture drop drastically and the shear viscosity of the mixture increases with decreasing depth. Under these conditions, we tested if the propagation of an acoustic wavefield generated by a source embedded in the magma column can generate an infrasonic wavefield in the atmosphere. The acoustic wavefield in the magma is here modeled as function of the void fraction in the magma and resonance is considered to be induced only by body-wave. Large gas bubble concentrations (>70\%) strongly affect the propagation properties of the acoustic wavefield. We found that the amplitude of the infrasonic wavefield in the atmosphere typically recorded in case of strombolian explosions (2 10 5 Pa) can be explained by a deep (>50 m) source embedded in the magma conduit only if a very large unrealistic pressure drop (10 13 Pa) is assumed. The strong damping, linked to the poor elastic properties of the shallow magma–gas mixture, prevents the efficient propagation of the acoustic waves in the magma–gas mixture, and resonance of body waves cannot occur. Infrasonic waves can be transmitted from the magma to the atmosphere only when the source is very shallow (<10 m). In conclusion, we neglect the possibility that resonance of body waves can induce infrasonic waves in the atmosphere. Moreover, we introduce new evidence of a strong attenuation induced by the shear viscosity on the propagation of elastic waves in a gas-rich magma. We believe that this latter result could have also a large impact on all the theories based on the resonance of elastic waves in a conduit as model to explain tremor and/or LP events on volcanoes.},

abstract = {Single forces are often observed in the source mechanism of volcanic seismicity. However, their underlying causative processes are still doubtful. The reliability of single force observations must be assessed, prior to an- alyzing them in terms of physical mechanisms. Using numerical examples, we show that source mislocation and velocity mismodeling lead to strong spurious single forces. Layering in the velocity model produces converted S-waves and source mislocations modify the wave fi eld at the free surface (mainly through converted S- and surface waves). However, these waves can also be accurately reproduced in a homogeneous model by adding a vertical single force in the source mechanism, which mainly generates S-waves for large take-off angles. Hence approximate velocity models can lead to the appearance of strong single forces in source inversions. We conclude that, in moment tensor inversion, while single forces can be used in some cases to accommodate mismodeling errors, they cannot be reliably used to infer physical processes.},

Previous studies of seismic wave velocities in solid-liquid mixtures either have been theoretical or have been based on experimental measurements on simple systems (e.g. Spetzler and Anderson, 1968; GS; Stocker and Gordon, 1975). Direct measurements on partially molten mantle material are needed, however, and in the work described here the compressional wave velocity of a peridotite has been measured through its melting range at 1 atm. The eventual objective is to measure the seismic wave velocities of partially molten mantle material at high pressures and the present experiments are a first step toward that objective.},

abstract = {In volcanoes that store a significant quantity of magma within a subsurface summit reservoir, such as Kı ̄lauea, bulk compression of stored magma is an im- portant mode of deformation. Accumulation of magma is also accompanied by crustal deformation, usually manifested at the surface as uplift. These two modes of deformation – bulk compression of resident magma and deformation of the volcanic edifice – act in concert to accommodate the volume of newly added magma. During deflation, the processes reverse and reservoir magma undergoes bulk decompression, the chamber contracts, and the ground surface subsides. Because magma compression plays a role in creating subsurface volume to accommodate magma, magma budget esti- mates that are derived from surface uplift observations without consideration of magma compression will un- derestimate actual magma volume changes.},

The model is referenced to previously published standard state thermodynamic properties and is derived from a set of internally consistent thermodynamic models for solid solutions of the igneous rock forming minerals, including: (Mg, Fe 2 +, Ca)-olivines, (Na, Mg, Fe 2 +, Ca) M2 (Mg, Fe 2+, Ti, Fe 3+, A1) M1 (Fe 3+, A1, Si)2T\~{}a'O6 - pyroxenes, (Na,Ca,K)-feldspars, (Mg, Fe 2 +) (Fe 3 +, A1, Cr)20r Fe2+)2 TiO4 spinels and (Fe2+,Mg, Mn 2 \~{}-)TiO3-Fe203 rhombohedral oxides. The calib- ration utilizes over 2,500 experimentally determined compositions of silicate liquids coexisting at known temperatures, pressures and oxygen fugacities with apatite \_+ feldspar +\_ leucite \_+ olivine + pyroxene + quartz \_\_+ rhombohedral oxides \_+ spinel \_+ whit- lockite + water. The model is applicable to natural magmatic compositions (both hydrous and anhyd- rous), ranging from potash ankaratrites to rhyolites, over the temperature (T) range 900\~{} \~{} C and pres- sures (P) up to 4 GPa. The model is implemented as a software package (MELTS) which may be used to simulate igneous processes such as (1) equilibrium or fractional crystallization, (2) isothermal, isenthalpic or isochoric assimilation, and (3) degassing of volatiles. Phase equilibria are predicted using the MELTS pack- age by specifying bulk composition of the system and either (1) T and P, (2) enthalpy (H) and P, (3) entropy (S) and P, or (4) T and volume (V). Phase relations in systems open to oxygen are detcrmined by directly specifying the/o2 or the T-P-fo\~{} (or equivalently H-P-f;\~{}, S-P-fo2, T-V-L) evolution path. Calculations are per- formed by constrained minimization of the appropriate thermodynamic potential.

@article{Francis1982,
abstract = {ike other great tholeiite sheets of the world, the Midland Valley Sill and Whin Sill were emplaced in thick accumulations of sediments which, at the time of intrusion, were not much older nor had been orogenically deformed. However, the Carboniferous sediments of northern Britain had been deposited under the influence of continuous differential subsidence, so that they were already disposed in syn-sedimentary basins and swells when intrusion began. By drawing palinspastic contours of the sills relative to a late Westphalian marine band (approximating to the surface at the time of emplacement) it is established that the dolerites mainly follow bedding planes, dipping at angles of as much as 5" down to the bottoms of the basins. Isopachs of the sills indicate a further relationship, for the intrusions are thickest at the bottoms of the basins. These facts are not explained by any intrusion mechanism previously postulated, though there seems to be broad agreement as to the processes which have given rise to thinning and en echelon lensing at leading edges as well as to step-and-stair transgression of sediment bedding. It is proposed that emplacement must have been controlled in part by gravitational flow down dip from feeder dykes which extended to between 0.5 and 1.0 km below the contemporary surface. Thereafter hydrostatic equilibrium was attained first by accumulation at the bottom of the basins and then by further advance up-dip under pressure of head. The sheets are so similar in aspect to flood basalts that it must be assumed that the sediments offered only low frictional resisiance to splitting and flow.},

abstract = {Gravity controls the movement of magmas through the density?zoned lithosphere, and plays a pre?eminent role in determining the course of magmatism. It is inferred from the widespread nature of volcanism that hydrostatic pressure (mainly gravitational in origin) is capable of bringing most mafic magmas and all silicic magmas to the surface. The abundance of intrusions and the presence of long?lived magma chambers in many volcanoes suggests that ascending magma may alternatively stop at the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB). This is the level at which the density/depth profile for a magma intersects the density/depth profile for the lithosphere; the level above which the rocks are less dense than the magma. It is the level where a magma is in gravitational equilibrium. If a magma chamber develops and swells there, gravity may then cause lateral magma excursions along the LNB. Several cases illustrate possible consequences of magmatic intrusion at the LNB. Where a large volume of mafic magma accumulates at a deep crustal LNB, changes (fractionation, assimilation) may cause its density to decrease and enable it to rise to the surface when it acquires positive buoyancy. This storage can explain how single flood basalt lava flows can have a great volume (≥ 10 km3), though monogenetic volcanoes demonstrate that a small volume (< 1 km3) of mafic magma is all that is required to penetrate the lithosphere. Deep?crustal storage also readily explains the absence of mantle xenoliths from flood?basalt flows. In another case the ponding of mafic magma at the LNB beneath an intracrustal silicic magma body assists the ascent and eruption of the silicic magma. An example from Hawaii illustrates that intrusions have changed the crustal?density zonation and shifted the LNB, influencing the localization of subsequent intrusions as non?vertical bladed dykes. Finally, two situations are considered in which great intracrustal prisms of mafic and ultra?mafic intrusions and cumulates, such as give rise to very large positive Bouguer gravity anomalies, can develop as the traces of upwardly migrating magma chambers at a rising LNB.

abstract = {Campi Flegrei (Italy) caldera has experienced episodes of ground deformation throughout its geological history, alternating between uplift and subsidence phases. Although uplift periods are typically more alarming, here we focus on subsidence, looking for its driving mechanisms and its role in the caldera evolution. Historical and archaeological records constrain ground deformation over the last two millennia. Here we revise such records and combine them with published radiometric dating and with the simulation of sea level change. The resulting analysis highlights for the first time a rapid subsidence during the fifth century. We show that rate and magnitude of this subsidence are consistent with the compaction of porous material caused by a pressure drop of \~{} 1 MPa within the hydrothermal system. We interpret this event as the decompression of the hydrothermal system following an unrecognized episode of unrest, during Roman times. These findings redefine the pattern of ground deformation and bear important implications for volcanic hazard assessment.},

abstract = {The Phlegrean Fields is an active caldera structure, located on the periphery of Naples (Italy). After the last eruptive event (the Monte Nuovo eruption in 1538), periodic episodes of unrest have characterized the evolution of this volcanic district, involving seismic activity and slow ground motion (bradyseism). During these episodes of unrest, some remarkable changes have also affected the composition of the hydrothermal fluids discharged at La Solfatara fumarolic field. These unrest phenomena result from the complex interaction between magma chamber, hydrothermal fluid circulation, and country rocks undergoing thermal and mechanical stresses. In order to make an effective hazard assessment in such a densely populated area as the Phlegrean Fields, we must first reach a better understanding of the mechanism driving bradyseismic activity and determine the relation between ground deformation and hydrothermal fluid circulation. In this work, we present some results of numerical modeling of both the hydrothermal fluid circulation at La Solfatara, and of its effects on rock deformation. The modeling results show that periods of intensified magmatic degassing can explain many features of the recent crises of unrest at Phlegrean Fields. ?? 2004 CNR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Perugini2015,
abstract = {The mixing of magmas is a common phenomenon in explosive eruptions. Concentration variance is a useful metric of this process and its decay (CVD) with time is an inevitable consequence during the progress of magma mixing. In order to calibrate this petrological/volcanological clock we have performed a time-series of high temperature experiments of magma mixing. The results of these experiments demonstrate that compositional variance decays exponentially with time. With this calibration the CVD rate (CVD-R) becomes a new geochronometer for the time lapse from initiation of mixing to eruption. The resultant novel technique is fully independent of the typically unknown advective history of mixing - a notorious uncertainty which plagues the application of many diffusional analyses of magmatic history. Using the calibrated CVD-R technique we have obtained mingling-to-eruption times for three explosive volcanic eruptions from Campi Flegrei (Italy) in the range of tens of minutes. These in turn imply ascent velocities of 5-8 meters per second. We anticipate the routine application of the CVD-R geochronometer to the eruptive products of active volcanoes in future in order to constrain typical "mixing to eruption" time lapses such that monitoring activities can be targeted at relevant timescales and signals during volcanic unrest.},

@article{Turner1986,
abstract = {This paper reviews advances made during the last seven years in the application of fluid dynamics to problems of igneous petrology, with emphasis on the laboratory work with which the authors have been particularly involved. Attention is focused on processes in magma chambers which produce diversity in igneous rocks, such as fractional crystallization, assimilation and magma mixing. Chamber geometry, and variations in the density and viscosity of the magma within it, are shown to play a major role in determining the dynamical behaviour and the composition of the erupted or solidified products. Various convective processes are first reviewed, and in particular the phenomenon of double-diffusive convection. Two types of double-diffusive interfaces between layers of different composition and temperature are likely to occur in magma chambers. A diffusive interface forms when a layer of hot dense magma is overlain by cooler less dense magma. Heat is transported between the layers faster than composition, driving convection in both layers and maintaining a sharp interface between them. If a layer of hot slightly less dense magma overlies a layer of cooler, denser but compositionally lighter magma, a finger interface forms between them, and compositional differences are transported downwards faster than heat (when each is expressed in terms of the corresponding density changes). Processes leading to the establishment of density, compositional and thermal gradients or steps during the filling of a magma chamber are considered next. The stratification produced, and the extent of mixing between the inflowing and resident magmas, are shown to depend on the flow rate and on the relation between the densities and viscosities of the two components. Slow dense inputs of magma may mix very little with resident magma of comparable viscosity as they spread across the floor of the chamber. A similar pulse injected with high upward momentum forms a turbulent "fountain", which is a very efficient mechanism for magma mixing, as is a turbulent plume of less dense magma rising through the host magma to the top of the chamber. The form of convection in the filled magma chamber is controlled by the shape and size of the chamber, the viscosity of the magma (through the Rayleigh number which is usually high in the early stages of cooling), and by processes at the boundary which produce lighter or denser fluid than that in the interior of the chamber. Compositional convection due to fluid released by crystallization often dominates over thermal convection. If crystallization at the bottom of a funnel-shaped chamber releases a light magma, this convects away from the floor, causing turbulent convection which tends to homogenize the overlying melt. If the magma released is dense, it flows down the sloping floor and stratifies the magma at the base of the chamber. Convection driven by crystallization in an inverted funnel has the reverse effect, e.g. dense fluid released at the sloping roof now has a homogenizing influence. Assimilation of wall rocks can also lead to identical dynamical effects and thus to zoning in magma chambers. Melting of a light roof, for instance, can produce a layer of cool felsic magma overlying the hotter more basic magma in the lower part of the chamber, with a diffusive interface between them. Assimilation has also been discussed for other geometries: assimilation of the walls of dykes, sills and lava flows can occur when the flow is hot and turbulent, whereas if the flow is laminar the magma will chill against the adjacent rocks and protect them from assimilation. When the magma in a chamber is layered, crystallization can cause the composition and density to change in several ways which may lead to mixing. A crystallizing lower layer of hot dense magma can evolve till it has the density of the magma above it, causing sudden overturning and thorough mixing. On the other hand, with a much more viscous layer above, light fluid is released continuously during crystallization and rises to the top of the chamber with little mixing. Overturning of a gas-rich mafic lower layer into a cooler silicic layer can cause a sudden quenching, with the rapid release of gas which could trigger an explosive eruption. Mixing can also occur during eruption, as two layers are drawn up simultaneously from a stratified chamber when a critical flow velocity is exceeded, and they then mix in the outlet vent. Laboratory experiments suggest, however, that magma mixing is inhibited by large viscosity differences, both during the filling and emptying of a magma chamber. Scaling these results to magmas indicates that a basaltic magma can flow into the bottom of a chamber containing rhyolite with little or no mixing between them, and that these two magma types can also flow out through the same exit vent with limited mixing. Each of the phenomena discussed in this review has been studied, at least in a qualitative way, using laboratory experiments to identify and understand a significant physical process occurring in magma chambers. The field of geological fluid mechanics and its application to these problems is still very new, and further advances seem assured as new phenomena are identified and more detailed and quantitative analogue experiments are developed to study them.},

@article{Costa2002,
abstract = {Magma viscosity is strongly temperature-dependent. When hot magma flows in a conduit, heat is lost through the walls and the temperature decreases along the flow causing a viscosity increase. For particular values of the controlling parameters the steady-flow regime in a conduit shows two stable solutions belonging either to the slow or to the fast branch. As a consequence, this system may show an hysteresis effect, and the transition between the two branches can occur quickly when the critical points are reached. In this paper we describe a model to study the relation between the pressure at the inlet and the volumetric magma flow rate in a conduit. We apply this model to explain an hysteric jump observed during the dome growth at Soufriere Hills volcano (Montserrat), and described by Melnik and Sparks [1999] using a different model.},

@article{Amoruso2014,
abstract = {We analyze 1980-2010 ground displacements, to discern similarities or differences between Campi Flegrei (CF) inflations and deflations and highlight possible anomalies in particular areas. We show that the deformation pattern can be decomposed into two stationary (constant over time, except for a mere scaling factor) parts; both of them are satisfied by simple deformation sources. A quasi-horizontal elongated crack (oriented NW to SE, and embedded in an elastic layered half-space at a depth of about 3600 m) satisfies large-scale deformation. All source parameters but potency (volume change) are constant over time. Residual deformation is confined to the area of the Solfatara fumarolic field and satisfied by a small spheroid located at about 1900 m in depth. Again, all source parameters but potency are constant over time. The histories of the two sources are somewhat similar but not equal, supporting the existence of a genuine local deformation source at Solfatara against the emergence of a mere distortion of large-scale deformation. Although reality is probably much more complex, our simple model explains 1980-2010 CF deformation within ground-displacement data errors and is consistent with Solfatara geochemical conceptual models, fumarolic geochemical data, and seismic attenuation imaging of CF. The observation that the CF deformation pattern can be decomposed into two stationary parts is hardly compatible with several recent works which proposed multiple sources with different features acting in different periods, fluid injections implying ample changes of large-scale deformation pattern over time, complex spatio-temporal patterns of distributions of volumetric sources.},

@article{Degruyter2014,
abstract = {Whether a magma body is able to produce eruptions and at what frequency remains a challenging problem in volcanology as it involves the nonlinear interplay of different processes acting over different time scales. Due to their complexity these are often considered independently in spite of their coupled nature. Here we consider an idealized model that focuses on the evolution of the thermodynamic state of the chamber (pressure, temperature, gas and crystal content) as new magma is injected into the chamber. The magma chamber cools in contact with the crust, which responds viscoelastically to the pressure accumulated during recharge and volatile exsolution. The magma is considered eruptible if the crystal volume fraction is smaller than 0.5. If a critical overpressure is reached, mass is released from the magma chamber until the lithostatic pressure is recovered. The setup of the model allows for rapid calculations that provide the opportunity to test the influence of competing processes on the evolution of the magma reservoir. We show how the frequency of eruptions depends on the timescale of injection, cooling, and viscous relaxation and develop a scaling law that relates these timescales to the eruption frequency. Based on these timescales we place different eruption triggering mechanisms (second boiling, mass injection, and buoyancy) in a coherent framework and evaluate the conditions needed to grow large magma reservoirs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Magmatic sheet intrusions (dykes) constitute the main form of magma transport in the Earth's crust. The size distribution of dykes is a crucial parameter that controls volcanic surface deformation and eruption rates and is required to realistically model volcano deformation for eruption forecasting. Here we present statistical analyses of 3,676 dyke thickness measurements from different tectonic settings and show that dyke thickness consistently follows the Weibull distribution. Known from materials science, power law-distributed flaws in brittle materials lead to Weibull-distributed failure stress. We therefore propose a dynamic model in which dyke thickness is determined by variable magma pressure that exploits differently sized host-rock weaknesses. The observed dyke thickness distributions are thus site-specific because rock strength, rather than magma viscosity and composition, exerts the dominant control on dyke emplacement. Fundamentally, the strength of geomaterials is scale-dependent and should be approximated by a probability distribution.},

abstract = {[1] Sintering and densification are ubiquitous processes influencing the emplacement of both effusive and explosive products of volcanic eruptions. Here we sinter ash-size fragments of a synthetic National Institute of Standards and Technology viscosity standard glass at temperatures at which the resultant melt has a viscosity of ∼10(8)-10(9) Pa.s at 1bar to assess sintering dynamics under near-surface volcanic conditions. We track the strength recovery via uniaxial compressive tests. We observe that volcanic ash sintering is dominantly time dependent, temperature dependent, and grain size dependent and may thus be interpreted to be controlled by melt viscosity and surface tension. Sintering evolves from particle agglutination to viscous pore collapse and is accompanied by a reduction in connected porosity and an increase in isolated pores. Sintering and densification result in a nonlinear increase in strength. Micromechanical modeling shows that the pore-emanated crack model explains the strength of porous lava as a function of pore fraction and size.},

We identify five main bubbling regimes based on synchronization among orifices, and discuss the parameters affecting the bubbling dynamics. Decreasing bubbler volume leads to a decrease in bubble volume and bubble period, and enhances synchronization. Increasing orifice diameter leads to an increase in bubble volume and enhances synchronization. Spacing between orifices doesn't play an important role in determining the bubbling regime. Based on the experimental observations, we develop new bubbling regime maps constructed using the dimensionless Capacitance number and Weber number.},

abstract = {The performance of the open source multiphase flow solver, interFoam, is evaluated in this work. The solver is based on a modified volume of fluid (VoF) approach, which incorporates an interfacial compression flux term to mitigate the effects of numerical smearing of the interface. It forms a part of the C + + libraries and utilities of OpenFOAM and is gaining popularity in the multiphase flow research community. However, to the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of this solver is confined to the validation tests of specific interest to the users of the code and the extent of its applicability to a wide range of multiphase flow situations remains to be explored. In this work, we have performed a thorough investigation of the solver performance using a variety of verification and validation test cases, which include (i) verification tests for pure advection (kinematics), (ii) dynamics in the high Weber number limit and (iii) dynamics of surface tension-dominated flows. With respect to (i), the kinematics tests show that the performance of interFoam is generally comparable with the recent algebraic VoF algorithms; however, it is noticeably worse than the geometric reconstruction schemes. For (ii), the simulations of inertia-dominated flows with large density ratios yielded excellent agreement with analytical and experimental results. In regime (iii), where surface tension is important, consistency of pressure–surface tension formulation and accuracy of curvature are important, as established by Francois et al (2006 J. Comput. Phys. 213 141–73). Several verification tests were performed along these lines and the main findings are: (a) the algorithm of interFoam ensures a consistent formulation of pressure and surface tension; (b) the curvatures computed by the solver converge to a value slightly (10{\%}) different from the analytical value and a scope for improvement exists in this respect. To reduce the disruptive effects of spurious currents, we followed the analysis of Galusinski and Vigneaux (2008 J. Comput. Phys. 227 6140–64) and arrived at the following criterion for stable capillary simulations for interFoam: where . Finally, some capillary flows relevant to atomization were simulated, resulting in good agreement with the results from the literature.},

abstract = {This is the second paper of two that examine numerical simulations of buoyancy-driven flow in the presence of large viscosity contrasts. In the first paper, we demonstrated that a combination of three numerical tools, an extended ghost fluid type method, the level set approach, and the extension velocity technique, accurately simulates complex interface dynamics in the presence of large viscosity contrasts. In this paper, we use this threefold numerical method to investigate bubble dynamics in the conduits of basaltic volcanos with a focus on normal Strombolian eruptions. Strombolian type activity, named after the famously episodic eruptions at Stromboli volcano, is characterized by temporally discrete fountains of incandescent clasts. The mildly explosive nature of normal Strombolian activity, as compared to more effusive variants of basaltic volcanism, is related to the presence of dissolved gas in the magma, yielding a complex two-phase flow problem. We present a detailed scaling analysis allowing identification of the pertinent regime for a given flow problem. The dynamic interactions between gas and magma can be classified into three nondimensional regimes on the basis of bubble sizes and magma viscosity. Resolving the fluid dynamics at the scale of individual bubbles is not equally important in all three regimes: As long as bubbles remain small enough to be spherical, their dynamic interactions are limited compared to the rich spectrum of coalescence and breakup processes observed for deformable bubbles, in particular, once inertia ceases to be negligible. One key finding in our simulations is that both large gas bubbles and large conduit-filling gas pockets ({\&}{\#}8220;slugs{\&}{\#}8221;) are prone to dynamic instabilities that lead to their rapid breakup during buoyancy-driven ascent. We provide upper bound estimates for the maximum stable bubble size in a given magmatic system and discuss the ramifications of our results for two commonly used models of normal Strombolian type activity, the rise-speed-dependent model and the collapsing foam model.},
