{\bf \noindent Response to reviewers' comments \\
Montagna and Gonnerman, Paper \#2012GC004469}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent We thank both reviewers for their thorough and thoughtful comments, which helped reshape and improve the manuscript. All of the points raised by each reviewer and by the Editor have been carefully addressed in full and we hope that the revised version of the manuscript is suitable for publication in G3.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent \underline{\bf Reviewer \#1}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it }

\vspace{0.3cm}

As suggested by the reviewer we have added some discussion about magma transport along rift zones in basaltic systems elsewhere (lines 303 - 310). We have also included the suggested references.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item {\it }

\vspace{0.3cm}

As suggested by the reviewer, we have added a paragraph in the concluding remarks wherein we discuss the relevance of the model to present day magma flow in K\={\i}lauea's east rift zone (lines 292 - 302).
\end{itemize}
