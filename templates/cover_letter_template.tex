\opening{Dear Dr. Tyburczy,}

We are submitting the revised version of our manuscript \lq Magma flow between summit and Pu`u `\=O`\=o at K\={\i}lauea Volcano, Hawai`i\rq. 

We thank both reviewers for their comments. In particular reviewer \#2 had very thorough and thoughtful suggestions. We believe that we have fully addressed and incorporated every comment and suggestion made by each reviewer in the revised manuscript. As a consequence we have also added several appendices to the manuscript. In addition, we include a detailed reply to the reviewers' comments as a separate document.

We hope that you will find our revisions satisfactory and the manuscript suitable for publication in G3 in its present form.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
